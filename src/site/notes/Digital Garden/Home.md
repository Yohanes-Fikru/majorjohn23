# Yohanes Fikru  
_Game Developer â€¢ Studio Co-Founder â€¢ Systems Thinker_

---

Welcome to my **digital garden** â€” a living collection of notes, experiments, and reflections on game development, creativity, systems, and tech.  
Built with Obsidian and a love for messy, evolving ideas.

Rather than a polished blog, this space is a work-in-progress â€”  
youâ€™ll find seeds, sketches, and slow-growing thoughts side by side.
