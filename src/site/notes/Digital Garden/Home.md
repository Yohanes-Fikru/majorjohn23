_Game Developer • Studio Co-Founder • Systems Thinker_

Welcome to my **digital garden** — a living collection of notes, experiments, and reflections on game development, creativity, systems, and tech.  
Built with Obsidian and a love for messy, evolving ideas.

Rather than a polished blog, this space is a work-in-progress —  
you’ll find seeds, sketches, and slow-growing thoughts side by side.
